# Day 6: Let's Review


## Objective 
Today we're expanding our knowledge of Strings and combining it with what we've already learned about loops. Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-review-loop/tutorial) tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

## Task 
Given a string, **_S_**, of length **_N_** that is indexed from **0** to **N - 1**, print its _even-indexed_ and _odd-indexed_ characters as **2** space-separated strings on a single line (see the Sample below for more detail).

**Note**:  is considered to be an even index.


### Input Format

The first line contains an integer, **T** (the number of test cases). 
Each line **i** of the **T** subsequent lines contain a String, **S**.

### Constraints

- **1 <= T <= 10**
- **-2 <= _length of S_ <= 1000**

### Output Format

For each String **_S<sub>j</sub>_** (where **0 <= j <= T-1**), print **_S<sub>j</sub>_**'s _even-indexed_ characters, followed by a space, followed by **_S<sub>j</sub>_**'s _odd-indexed_ characters.

### Sample Input

```Python
2
Hacker
Rank
```

### Sample Output

```Python
Hce akr
Rn ak
```
