# Day 7: Arrays


## Objective 
Today, we're learning about the Array data structure. Check out the [Tutorial](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-arrays/tutorial) tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

## Task 
Given an array, **A**, of **_N_** integers, print **_A_**'s elements in _reverse_ order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

### Input Format

The first line contains an integer, **N** (the size of our array). 
The second line contains **N** space-separated integers describing array **_A_**'s elements.

### Constraints

- **1 <= N <= 1000**
- **1 <= _A<sub>i</sub>_ <= 10000**, where A<sub>i</sub> is the _i<sup>th</sup>_ integer in the array.

### Output Format

Print the elements of array **A** in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

### Sample Input

```Python
4
1 4 3 2
```

### Sample Output

```Python
2 3 4 1
```
